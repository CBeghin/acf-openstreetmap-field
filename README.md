ACF OpenStreetMap Field
=======================

Configurable OpenStreetMap or Leaflet Field in ACF.  
Requires ACF 5.7+

This plugin is still under heavy development. Better do not use it in a production environment.

ToDO:
-----
 - [ ] Code: load minified scripts
 - [ ] Code: Move register_script to Core class
 - [ ] Code: Refactor Field/OpenStreetMap
 - [ ] UI: Better layer select and sort in editor view. (Leaflet?)
 - [ ] UI: Better marker select. Name marker Label
 - [ ] Reverse Geocoding seems buggy.
 - [ ] Widgets
	 - [ ] Bug: Map doesn't load tiles, when widget is closed.
	 - [ ] JS: Trigger change on map pan and zoom, so the save button is enabled.
 - [ ] Frontend: Map height fallback value
 - [ ] Frontend: Allow Theme override of OSM and Leaflet HTML. (Template Tags? Actions?)
 - [ ] Frontend: Allow custom marker HTML.
 - [ ] Go Beta
